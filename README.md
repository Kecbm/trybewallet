# Skills

In this project, I was able to:

- Create a Redux store in React applications

- Create reducers in Redux in React applications

- Create actions in Redux in React applications

- Create dispatchers in Redux in React applications

- Connect Redux to React components

- Create asynchronous actions in your React application that uses Redux.

## What was developed

In this project I developed an application in React that uses Redux as a state manipulation tool. Through this application, it will be possible to perform the basic operations of creating and manipulating a redux state. A spending control wallet with currency converter, when using this application a user should be able to:

- Add and remove an expense;
- View tables with your expenses;
- View total expenses converted to a currency of choice;
